            <h2>Colors</h2>

            <p>The colors I will use are the main color of blue and a goldish yellow to compliment it. 
            To give it a sense of trust and calmness about it as you read through the game recommendations. 
            I'll use most of the colors for the headers and keep the text black for readability. I'll also user
            some light gray so there is less white showing on the page.  
            </p>

        <section class="fonts">
            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>The fonts I will be using are mainly Sans Serif with a few different iterations of it for
                a simple font that doesn't hurt to look at.
